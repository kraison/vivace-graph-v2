;; SBCL's hash-table's are implemented as STRUCTURE-OBJECT with

;; The spinlock is used for locking cl:gethash/(setf cl:gethash)/cl:remhash and

;;            :type sb-thread::spinlock :read-only t)
;;
;; IOW, there doesn't appear to be MUTEX.
;; 
;; In any event, I'm not comfortable understanding how to incorporate
;; bordeaux-threads MUTEX frobbing with SBCL's spinlocks... though it appears
;; that a spinlock not entirely unlike a MUTEX. Following from

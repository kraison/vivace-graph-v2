 [vivace-graph-devel] vivace-graph moving again

I (mon-key) have replaced the original per item numeric annotations with
asterisks and changed the read order to accomodate re-grouping of related
tasks. This re-grouping occured under the assumption that the original numeric
ordering of KR's requirements did necessarily imply that some requierment-A was
implicitly more important / required than some other requirement-Z.

;;; ==============================
The major things that need to be done to satisfy my personal requirements:

*  Stabilize transaction logging.

*   Remove the SBCL-specific code that litters the project.

*   Make a choice on what sort of on-disk storage mechanism to use.  
    Currently, all data must fit in RAM and is persisted via snapshotting and
    transaction logging.

    I would like to add a second option where, as in a standard database, data
    can be stored in a disk-based structure. 

     - B+Trees  

     - Fractal Prefetching B+Trees 
       (http://reports-archive.adm.cs.cmu.edu/anon/2002/CMU-CS-02-115.pdf)?

     - B-Tries
       I expressed concern to Red and Ilya about using B-trees, given the
       extremely high fanout of the indices.

       I was considering something like B-tries, as described in this paper:
        (URL `http://www.naskitis.com/naskitis-vldbj09.pdf').

*   Spend some time on the text indexing piece.
    It currently uses my cl-skip-list, but should be moved into a B-tree.

*   While triples are thread safe, Prolog may or may not be.
    This should be investigated and fixed where necessary.

*   Fix lexical env issues between Prolog and Lisp.
    Currently, importing a Lisp variable into Prolog requires that it be
    declared SPECIAL.  This is because the Prolog implementation is based on
    Norvig's PAIP, which uses CL:EVAL.  A better solution should be found.

*   Add reciprocal reasoning. 
     (has-child implies has-parent)

*   Factor out the certainty factors code.
     - Make CFs first class triples
       Currently these are a mutable fields of the structure TRIPLE. 

*   Incorporate Geospatial / Temporal reasoning

*   Incorporate forward chaining rules engine.
     (Rete or LEAPS-derived)

*   Incorporate more RDF-related stuff. 
    (Sparql, N-Triples parser / loader, etc.)

*   Implement a protocol for submitting queries over the network.
